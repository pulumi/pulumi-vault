/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * const userpass = new vault.AuthBackend("userpass", {type: "userpass"});
 * const u1 = new vault.generic.Endpoint("u1", {
 *     path: "auth/userpass/users/u1",
 *     ignoreAbsentFields: true,
 *     dataJson: `{
 *   "policies": ["p1"],
 *   "password": "changeme"
 * }
 * `,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [userpass],
 * });
 * const u1Token = new vault.generic.Endpoint("u1Token", {
 *     path: "auth/userpass/login/u1",
 *     disableRead: true,
 *     disableDelete: true,
 *     dataJson: `{
 *   "password": "changeme"
 * }
 * `,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [u1],
 * });
 * const u1Entity = new vault.generic.Endpoint("u1Entity", {
 *     disableRead: true,
 *     disableDelete: true,
 *     path: "identity/lookup/entity",
 *     ignoreAbsentFields: true,
 *     writeFields: ["id"],
 *     dataJson: `{
 *   "alias_name": "u1",
 *   "alias_mount_accessor": vault_auth_backend.userpass.accessor
 * }
 * `,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [u1Token],
 * });
 * export const u1Id = u1Entity.writeData.id;
 * ```
 * ## Required Vault Capabilities
 *
 * Use of this resource requires the `create` or `update` capability
 * (depending on whether the resource already exists) on the given path. If
 * `disableDelete` is false, the `delete` capability is also required. If
 * `disableRead` is false, the `read` capability is required.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Import is not supported for this resource.
