/**
 * Reads arbitrary data from a given path in Vault.
 *
 * This resource is primarily intended to be used with
 * [Vault's "generic" secret backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/generic/index.html),
 * but it is also compatible with any other Vault endpoint that supports
 * the `vault read` command.
 *
 * > **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
 * written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
 * the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
 * if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
 * Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
 * the main provider documentation
 * for more details.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Generic secret
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * const rundeckAuth = vault.generic.getSecret({
 *     path: "secret/rundeck_auth",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### KV
 *
 * For this example, consider `example` as a path for a KV engine.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * function notImplemented(message: string) {
 *     throw new Error(message);
 * }
 *
 * const exampleCreds = vault.generic.getSecret({
 *     path: "example/creds",
 * });
 * const exampleTemplate = notImplemented("The template_file data resource is not yet supported.");
 * ```
 *
 * ## Required Vault Capabilities
 *
 * Use of this resource requires the `read` capability on the given path.
