 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * const rundeckAuth = vault.generic.getSecret({
 *     path: "secret/rundeck_auth",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Required Vault Capabilities
 *
 * Use of this resource requires the `read` capability on the given path.
