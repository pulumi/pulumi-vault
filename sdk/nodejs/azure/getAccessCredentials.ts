/**
 * Reads Azure credentials from an Azure secret backend in Vault.
 *
 * > **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
 * written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
 * the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
 * if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
 * Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
 * the main provider documentation
 * for more details.
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * The Azure Active Directory data source exists to easily pull short-lived
 * credentials from Vault for use in Terraform. By default, it returns a
 * dynamically generated `clientId` and `clientSecret` without testing
 * whether they've fully propagated for use in Azure Active Directory. However,
 * by activating `validateCreds`, credentials will be tested before being
 * returned. This will, however, increase the time it takes for the credentials
 * to be returned, blocking Terraform's execution until they are ready.
 *
 * If `validateCreds` is used, by default, credentials will be validated by
 * making a test call to Azure every 1 seconds. When we have received 8
 * successes in a row, the credentials will be returned. We have seen propagation
 * times take up to 15 minutes, so the maximum length of time for the check defaults
 * to 20 minutes. However, propagation times will vary widely based on each company's Azure
 * usage, so all these settings are configurable.
 *
 * Credentials are tested by attempting to refresh a client token with them.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * const creds = vault.azure.getAccessCredentials({
 *     role: "my-role",
 *     validateCreds: true,
 *     numSequentialSuccesses: 8,
 *     numSecondsBetweenTests: 1,
 *     maxCredValidationSeconds: 300,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Caveats
 *
 * The `validateCreds` option requires read-access to the `backend` config endpoint.
 * If the effective Vault role does not have the required permissions then valid values
 * are required to be set for: `subscriptionId`, `tenantId`, `environment`.
