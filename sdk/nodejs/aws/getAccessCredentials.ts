/**
 * Reads AWS credentials from an AWS secret backend in Vault.
 *
 * > **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
 * written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
 * the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
 * if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
 * Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
 * the main provider documentation
 * for more details.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * When using the outputs of this data source to authenticate with the Terraform Provider for AWS or
 * the Terraform Provider for AWS Cloud Control,
 * the credentials leased from Vault cannnot be renewed.
 * Ensure that the lease is long enough for Terraform to complete.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vault from "@pulumi/vault";
 *
 * const aws = new vault.aws.SecretBackend("aws", {
 *     accessKey: "AKIA.....",
 *     secretKey: "SECRETKEYFROMAWS",
 * });
 * const role = new vault.aws.SecretBackendRole("role", {
 *     backend: aws.path,
 *     name: "test",
 *     policy: `{
 *   \\"Version\\": \\"2012-10-17\\",
 *   \\"Statement\\": [
 *     {

 *       \\"Action\\": \\"iam:*\\",
 *       \\"Resource\\": \\"*\\"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * `,
 * });
 * // generally, these blocks would be in a different module
 * const creds = pulumi.all([aws.path, role.name]).apply(([path, name]) => vault.aws.getAccessCredentialsOutput({
 *     backend: path,
 *     role: name,
 * }));
 * ```
