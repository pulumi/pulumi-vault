        Get an existing AuthBackendRole resource's state with the given name, id, and optional extra
        properties used to qualify the lookup.

        :param str resource_name: The unique name of the resulting resource.
        :param str id: The unique provider ID of the resource to lookup.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_instance_migration: If set to `true`, allows migration of
               the underlying instance where the client resides.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] auth_type: The auth type permitted for this role. Valid choices
               are `ec2` and `iam`. Defaults to `iam`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend: Unique name of the auth backend to configure.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_account_ids: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
               instances that can perform the login operation that they should be using the
               account ID specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
               `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_ami_ids: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
               that can perform the login operation that they should be using the AMI ID
               specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
               `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.

        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_iam_instance_profile_arns: If set, defines a constraint on
               the EC2 instances that can perform the login operation that they must be
               associated with an IAM instance profile ARN which has a prefix that matches
               the value specified by this field. The value is prefix-matched as though it
               were a glob ending in `*`. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
               `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_iam_principal_arns: If set, defines the IAM principal that
               must be authenticated when `auth_type` is set to `iam`. Wildcards are
               supported at the end of the ARN.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_iam_role_arns: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
               instances that can perform the login operation that they must match the IAM
               role ARN specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
               `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_regions: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
               that can perform the login operation that the region in their identity
               document must match the one specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set
               to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this
               constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_subnet_ids: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
               instances that can perform the login operation that they be associated with
               the subnet ID that matches the value specified by this field. `auth_type`
               must be set to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance`
               to use this constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_vpc_ids: If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
               that can perform the login operation that they be associated with the VPC ID
               that matches the value specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to
               `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this
               constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] disallow_reauthentication: IF set to `true`, only allows a
               single token to be granted per instance ID. This can only be set when
               `auth_type` is set to `ec2`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] inferred_aws_region: When `inferred_entity_type` is set, this
               is the region to search for the inferred entities. Required if
               `inferred_entity_type` is set. This only applies when `auth_type` is set to
               `iam`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] inferred_entity_type: If set, instructs Vault to turn on
               inferencing. The only valid value is `ec2_instance`, which instructs Vault to
               infer that the role comes from an EC2 instance in an IAM instance profile.
               This only applies when `auth_type` is set to `iam`.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] max_ttl: The maximum allowed lifetime of tokens
               issued using this role, provided as a number of seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] period: If set, indicates that the
               token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
               duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
               value of this field. Specified in seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] policies: An array of strings
               specifying the policies to be set on tokens issued using this role.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] resolve_aws_unique_ids: If set to `true`, the
               `bound_iam_principal_arns` are resolved to [AWS Unique
               IDs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids)
               for the bound principal ARN. This field is ignored when a
               `bound_iam_principal_arn` ends in a wildcard. Resolving to unique IDs more
               closely mimics the behavior of AWS services in that if an IAM user or role is
               deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
               roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior
               principals of the same name. Defaults to `true`.
               Once set to `true`, this cannot be changed to `false` without recreating the role.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] role: The name of the role.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] role_tag: If set, enable role tags for this role. The value set
               for this field should be the key of the tag on the EC2 instance. `auth_type`
               must be set to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance`
               to use this constraint.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] token_bound_cidrs: List of CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP
               addresses which can authenticate successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks
               as well.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_explicit_max_ttl: If set, will encode an
               [explicit max TTL](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls)
               onto the token in number of seconds. This is a hard cap even if `token_ttl` and
               `token_max_ttl` would otherwise allow a renewal.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_max_ttl: The maximum lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
               Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] token_no_default_policy: If set, the default policy will not be set on
               generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set in token_policies.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_num_uses: The
               [period](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls),
               if any, in number of seconds to set on the token.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_period: If set, indicates that the
               token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
               duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
               value of this field. Specified in seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] token_policies: List of policies to encode onto generated tokens. Depending
               on the auth method, this list may be supplemented by user/group/other values.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_ttl: The incremental lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
               Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] token_type: The type of token that should be generated. Can be `service`,
               `batch`, or `default` to use the mount's tuned default (which unless changed will be
               `service` tokens). For token store roles, there are two additional possibilities:
               `default-service` and `default-batch` which specify the type to return unless the client
               requests a different type at generation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] ttl: The TTL period of tokens issued
               using this role, provided as a number of seconds.
