        ## Required Vault Capabilities

        Use of this resource requires the `create` or `update` capability
        (depending on whether the resource already exists) on the given path. If
        `disable_delete` is false, the `delete` capability is also required. If
        `disable_read` is false, the `read` capability is required.

        ## Import

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] data_json: String containing a JSON-encoded object that will be
               written to the given path as the secret data.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] disable_delete: - (Optional) True/false. Set this to true if your
               vault authentication is not able to delete the data or if the endpoint
               does not support the `DELETE` method. Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] disable_read: True/false. Set this to true if your vault
               authentication is not able to read the data or if the endpoint does
               not support the `GET` method. Setting this to `true` will break drift
               detection. You should set this to `true` for endpoints that are
               write-only. Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] ignore_absent_fields: - (Optional) True/false. If set to true,
               ignore any fields present when the endpoint is read but that were not
               in `data_json`. Also, if a field that was written is not returned when
               the endpoint is read, treat that field as being up to date. You should
               set this to `true` when writing to endpoint that, when read, returns a
               different set of fields from the ones you wrote, as is common with
               many configuration endpoints. Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] namespace: The namespace to provision the resource in.
               The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
               The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
               *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] path: The full logical path at which to write the given
               data. Consult each backend's documentation to see which endpoints
               support the `PUT` methods and to determine whether they also support
               `DELETE` and `GET`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] write_fields: - (Optional). A list of fields that should be returned
               in `write_data_json` and `write_data`. If omitted, data returned by
               the write operation is not available to the resource or included in
               state. This helps to avoid accidental storage of sensitive values in
               state. Some endpoints, such as many dynamic secrets endpoints, return
               data from writing to an endpoint rather than reading it. You should
               use `write_fields` if you need information returned in this way.
