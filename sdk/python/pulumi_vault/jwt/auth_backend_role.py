        """
        Get an existing AuthBackendRole resource's state with the given name, id, and optional extra
        properties used to qualify the lookup.

        :param str resource_name: The unique name of the resulting resource.
        :param str id: The unique provider ID of the resource to lookup.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] allowed_redirect_uris: The list of allowed values for redirect_uri during OIDC logins.
               Required for OIDC roles
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend: The unique name of the auth backend to configure.
               Defaults to `jwt`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_audiences: (Required for roles of type `jwt`, optional for roles of
               type `oidc`) List of `aud` claims to match against. Any match is sufficient.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] bound_cidrs: If set, a list of
               CIDRs valid as the source address for login requests. This value is also encoded into any resulting token.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] bound_claims: If set, a map of claims/values to match against.
               The expected value may be a single string or a list of strings.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] bound_subject: If set, requires that the `sub` claim matches
               this value.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] claim_mappings: If set, a map of claims (keys) to be copied
               to specified metadata fields (values).
        :param pulumi.Input[float] clock_skew_leeway: The amount of leeway to add to all claims to account for clock skew, in
               seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
               Only applicable with "jwt" roles.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] expiration_leeway: The amount of leeway to add to expiration (`exp`) claims to account for
               clock skew, in seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
               Only applicable with "jwt" roles.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] groups_claim: The claim to use to uniquely identify
               the set of groups to which the user belongs; this will be used as the names
               for the Identity group aliases created due to a successful login. The claim
               value must be a list of strings.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] groups_claim_delimiter_pattern: (Optional; Deprecated. This field has been
               removed since Vault 1.1. If the groups claim is not at the top level, it can
               now be specified as a [JSONPointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).)
               A pattern of delimiters
               used to allow the groups_claim to live outside of the top-level JWT structure.
               For instance, a groups_claim of meta/user.name/groups with this field
               set to // will expect nested structures named meta, user.name, and groups.
               If this field was set to /./ the groups information would expect to be
               via nested structures of meta, user, name, and groups.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] max_ttl: The maximum allowed lifetime of tokens
               issued using this role, provided as a number of seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] not_before_leeway: The amount of leeway to add to not before (`nbf`) claims to account for
               clock skew, in seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
               Only applicable with "jwt" roles.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] num_uses: If set, puts a use-count
               limitation on the issued token.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] oidc_scopes: If set, a list of OIDC scopes to be used with an OIDC role.
               The standard scope "openid" is automatically included and need not be specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] period: If set, indicates that the
               token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
               duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
               value of this field. Specified in seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] policies: An array of strings
               specifying the policies to be set on tokens issued using this role.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] role_name: The name of the role.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] role_type: Type of role, either "oidc" (default) or "jwt".
        :param pulumi.Input[list] token_bound_cidrs: List of CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP
               addresses which can authenticate successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks
               as well.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_explicit_max_ttl: If set, will encode an
               [explicit max TTL](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls)
               onto the token in number of seconds. This is a hard cap even if `token_ttl` and
               `token_max_ttl` would otherwise allow a renewal.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_max_ttl: The maximum lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
               Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] token_no_default_policy: If set, the default policy will not be set on
               generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set in token_policies.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_num_uses: The
               [period](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls),
               if any, in number of seconds to set on the token.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_period: If set, indicates that the
               token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
               duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
               value of this field. Specified in seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] token_policies: List of policies to encode onto generated tokens. Depending
               on the auth method, this list may be supplemented by user/group/other values.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] token_ttl: The incremental lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
               Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] token_type: The type of token that should be generated. Can be `service`,
               `batch`, or `default` to use the mount's tuned default (which unless changed will be
               `service` tokens). For token store roles, there are two additional possibilities:
               `default-service` and `default-batch` which specify the type to return unless the client
               requests a different type at generation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] ttl: The TTL period of tokens issued
               using this role, provided as a number of seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] user_claim: The claim to use to uniquely identify
               the user; this will be used as the name for the Identity entity alias created
               due to a successful login.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] verbose_oidc_logging: Log received OIDC tokens and claims when debug-level
               logging is active. Not recommended in production since sensitive information may be present
               in OIDC responses.
