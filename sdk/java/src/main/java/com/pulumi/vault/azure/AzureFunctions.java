     * Reads Azure credentials from an Azure secret backend in Vault.
     * 
     * &gt; **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
     * written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
     * the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
     * if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
     * Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
     * the main provider documentation
     * for more details.
     * 
     * ## Description
     * 
     * The Azure Active Directory data source exists to easily pull short-lived
     * credentials from Vault for use in Terraform. By default, it returns a
     * dynamically generated `clientId` and `clientSecret` without testing
     * whether they&#39;ve fully propagated for use in Azure Active Directory. However,
     * by activating `validateCreds`, credentials will be tested before being
     * returned. This will, however, increase the time it takes for the credentials
     * to be returned, blocking Terraform&#39;s execution until they are ready.
     * 
     * If `validateCreds` is used, by default, credentials will be validated by
     * making a test call to Azure every 1 seconds. When we have received 8
     * successes in a row, the credentials will be returned. We have seen propagation
     * times take up to 15 minutes, so the maximum length of time for the check defaults
     * to 20 minutes. However, propagation times will vary widely based on each company&#39;s Azure
     * usage, so all these settings are configurable.
     * 
     * Credentials are tested by attempting to refresh a client token with them.
     *

     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * ## Caveats
     * 
     * The `validateCreds` option requires read-access to the `backend` config endpoint.
     * If the effective Vault role does not have the required permissions then valid values
     * are required to be set for: `subscriptionId`, `tenantId`, `environment`.
